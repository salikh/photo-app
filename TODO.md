# TODO

Open task list for the photo manager web app. **All completed ticket pointers have been moved to
`STATUS.md`** — this file holds only open tickets and open questions. Plan:
`docs/plans/photo-manager-plan.md`; requirements: `docs/reqs/photo-manager-requirements.md`.
Tickets live in `docs/tickets/NNN.md`. Check an item off here (and move its pointer to
`STATUS.md`) when the ticket's status is done.

## Open tickets

All ten build-order epics, v1 filtering, every cross-cutting ticket, and epic 102 (103-107) are
done (see `STATUS.md`). Nothing open right now.

## Question tickets (waiting on the user)

Convention: a ticket that needs the user's input gets a **question ticket** (`Type: question`, with brief
context, the question, options if any, and an empty **Answer** section). The question lists what it
`Blocks:`; the blocked ticket has a `Blocked by:` line. When the user has answered, the question ticket is
closed and the blocked ticket continues (and its pointer moves to `STATUS.md`). A ticket is "actionable"
when it has no open blocker.

None open right now.

103 was answered 2026-09-24 (Option C, a downsampled still-mosaiced DNG via rawpy+tifffile, refined
from the user's initial Option B lean after checking what LibRaw-Wasm actually supports; see
`STATUS.md`) and unblocked 104 (done) and 105. 097 was answered 2026-09-24 (Option B; see
`STATUS.md`) and unblocked 098-100. 090 was answered 2026-09-23 (see `STATUS.md`) and unblocked 085.

To try things on a device: `./start.sh` (add `--one_star_is_unrated` if you want 1 star hidden), then open
`http://<this machine>:8080/` on the phone or tablet.
